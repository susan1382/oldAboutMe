    <div>
    <h2 id = "About_me"><ins>The "emotional" backstory</ins></h2>
      <p> I was born on March 29 in the year of the 2000s. I will not specify the year because when you're my age, you begin to feel old. I was born in Urbana, Illinois, and I moved to Boston, Massachusetts when I was 3 years old. When I was in elementary school, I would have violin, figure skating, soccer, math, Chinese, writing, coding,  swimming, gymnastics, and dancing classes. This was over the course of my elementary school year; I didn't have them all in the same year. I wasn't particularly interested in anything except for dance and math. Then in middle school I continued some of these classes and I also did middle school speech which I really enjoyed. Then in the summer of one of my middle school years, I got interested in coding again. Then I started doing coding classes again. The end. </p>

          It's preschool time everyone, this is when teachers need to make you get ready for elementary school while not being too harsh on you. I went to St. Columbkille's School which was a Catholic Private school so I had to wear a uniform and things like that. I got in a lot of trouble around this time and had to experience timeout even though most of the time I didn't know why I was in timeout.

          Elementary school is when you finally become a BIG kid. You start off as a clueless kindergarten and gradually level up until you're a fifth grader. Once you're a fifth grader, you practically rule the school; you're the oldest in the school and <em>supposedly</em> the most responsible. Then comes middle school, but we're still in elementary school so no one cares. I went to Bowen Elementary School, which meant I would go to Oak Hill Middle School.

          Now comes middle school, your elementary school days are over. No one cares what your status was in your previous school. Eighth graders rule the school and you're now the weaklings of the school. You're new to everything and nothing ever makes sense, so you follow the rules the best. Then in seventh grade, you start to go a little nuts and school rules just don't apply to you anymore and you're living the <strong>REBEL</strong> life. Then eighth grade happens, and you're the coolest kids in the school. You're hopefully taller than the sixth graders and if you aren't...well too bad. Eighth grade is normally when most of the best field trips happen, which is why eighth grade is a pretty nice year because it's the last year where things don't matter that much. High school is slowly approaching and you must prepare, so college isn't a pain.
